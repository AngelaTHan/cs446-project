InCRÊPEable is a recipe management and recipe-sharing app. Throughout history, recipes have come in many different forms. Some families have a collection of recipe books, or have recipes written down in a notebook or index cards. This is often very disorganized, and it is often challenging to find the wanted recipe. With InCRÊPEable, users will be able to store all their favorite recipes easily. Additionally, if the user is unsure of what they can make, they would be able to search for recipes that other users have posted based on specific search functions like ingredients and styles.
